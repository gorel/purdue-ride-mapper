==================

An app where users can easily and intuitively request or share rides

_Updated January 21, 2014_

**Problem Statement:** A Purdue Ride-Board group exists on Facebook that students use to carpool together.  Some students are trying to find a way home, while others are looking to take someone to help with gas.  The Facebook group’s usage is complex, inconsistent, and requires manual monitoring of posts in order to find a ride.  Some websites already exist for this type of software, but none are specifically for college students (and are therefore seen as shady to many students).

**Project Objectives:** This project will aim to create a web app where users can easily and intuitively request or share rides.

**Stakeholders:** Students looking to request or share a ride with other students on campus in a more convenient and consistent way than is currently available

**Project Deliverables:** To make the process of requesting or sharing a ride to or from campus for students, a web app with the following features will be created:
+ Ability to request a ride to a given destination
+ Ability to share a ride to a given destination
+ Automatically suggest people you could get a ride with based on destination proximity
+ Suggestion of how much to pay the driver based on current gas prices
+ Email alert when a matching request/share is found
+ Utilization of Google Maps to help students visualize how far a person could take you or how far out of your way you’d have to drive to give someone a ride to their destination
